# {{ Maddy Mengel}} - Portfolio Task


/* Start here */

This project is still in development and when I get the chance I'd like to go back and redo some of the code, including cleaning the file. I am yet to check responsiveness across browsers. 

Further understanding is required in the areas of:
- Media queries
- Responsiveness

/* Homepage */

The homepage is structured by header/navigation, hero, projects and a footer section that includes about and contact information. The page itself has been kept simple in structure, particularly with the project section to allow each project to fill a container. 

The most challenging part was the hamburger menu and the footer in regards to media queries and responsiveness. While it works for now, I am going to start the code from scratch and understand where I originally went wrong. For this reason, the hamburger is only on the home page. 

Features include:
- logo link to homepage
- navigation
- social links (open in new tab, hover effects)
- contact button (this will be an anchor eventually)
- ready for a chat button
- site favicon
- footer button (contact button has an underline that is to be removed)
- hamburger menu

Features to come:
- video in hero text
- rounded background on social link hover
- project information and styling
- footer content (back to top button, links)
- styling
- micro animations and transitions
- hamburger menu

/* Contact */

The contact page is a statement of colour and simplicity, designed to limit distraction to filling out the form. 

Features include:
- the page is fixed and does not scroll below the fold

Features to come:
- form submission (this is half set up in the html)
- mobile responsiveness
- hamburger menu
